# LibertyRecompAndroid — Mali Edition (Alpha)

> [!WARNING]
> **Alpha, work in progress.** This is a fork of
> [LibertyRecompAndroid](https://github.com/vaduur/LibertyRecompAndroid) that runs the game on
> **ARM Mali GPUs** (MediaTek Dimensity, Google Tensor, Samsung Exynos with Mali). Expect bugs and
> rough edges. If you have a Snapdragon (Adreno) phone, use the original project.

An Android port of [Liberty Recompiled](https://github.com/OZORDI/LibertyRecomp), the static
recompilation of the Xbox 360 version of Grand Theft Auto IV. The game runs **natively** on arm64
Android; there is no emulator in between. This fork uses the phone's own Mali Vulkan driver.

**Latest version: 0.5.9.3-mali-alpha-1.5** (based on upstream 0.5.9.3). Download it from
[Releases](../../releases).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Updating from alpha 1.3 or older:** uninstall the old version once before installing
> (back up `Android/data/com.libertyrecomp/` first if you want to keep your installed game). From
> 1.4 on, every build uses the same signing key, so later updates install normally.

## Supported GPUs

| GPU | Example phones | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Mali-G720 / Immortalis-G720 | Dimensity 8400 | ✅ Tested, playable |
| Mali-G615, Mali-G710 / G715 | Dimensity 8300, Google Pixel (Tensor) | 🟡 Should work (untested) |
| **Mali-G68, Mali-G610** and other GPUs without `shaderInt64` | Galaxy A35 / A55, Nothing Phone (2a) Plus, Dimensity 900 / 1080 / 7350, Exynos 1280 / 1380 | 🟡 **New in alpha 1.5:** runs with the 64-bit shader fallback (untested) |

Requirements: arm64, Android 10+, a Mali GPU with Vulkan 1.2 and `bufferDeviceAddress`, about
15 GB free during install. `shaderInt64` is **no longer required**.

## What's in the Mali Edition

### GTA IV-style launcher
- A launcher in the style of **GTA IV's menus**: Liberty City in the background, a menu on the
  left (**Play, Game files, Graphics & controls, Overlay, Driver, About**) with the selected item in
  orange, and one panel at a time on the right.
- **Graphics & controls** in three tabs (**Display, Performance, Touch**), every setting a GTA-style
  **◀ value ▶** option. *Default* keeps your `args.txt` value; press **Save changes**, then **Play**.
- **Menu sounds** for moving, selecting and going back (original sounds in the style of GTA IV).
- Works with a **controller**: A select, B back, ◀ ▶ change a setting.
- **Performance overlay:** a small corner box with the game's **real** FPS, frame time, CPU usage
  and clock, memory, and more (each line can be turned on or off).

### Liberty touch controls
- **Icon buttons that follow what you are doing:** on foot, driving, phone, pause menu, and
  cutscenes (with a **Skip** button). Hidden on loading screens.
- **Customisable:** hold **Pause** for 1.5 s to edit. **Drag** a button to move it, **pinch** with
  two fingers to resize it, **Reset** restores the screen's default layout, tap **Pause** to save.
- **Switch any time:** the gamepad icon at the top switches to a classic **Xbox controller**; its
  **LIBERTY** button switches back.

### Performance
- **CPU boost:** the game tells Android how fast its frames need to be (Performance Hint API) for
  all of its busy threads, so the phone keeps them on fast clocks. *Steady* is the default;
  *Maximum* boosts harder (warmer), *Battery* saves power.
- **Multi-core texture conversion:** new textures are prepared on several CPU cores instead of
  only the main game thread, for less stutter when driving into new areas.
- **Heat guard:** lowers the draw distance a little before the phone overheats and restores it
  once it cools, for steadier clocks instead of throttling (on by default for new installs).
- **Thread waiting:** how long busy game threads wait on each other before giving up the CPU.
- Upstream 0.5.9.3's optimisations: 16-bit textures for the most common DXT format, GPU texture
  untiling, and faster recompiled code.

### Mali compatibility fixes
- **No `shaderInt64` on many Mali GPUs:** the shaders' 64-bit numbers (GPU memory addresses) are
  rewritten as pairs of 32-bit numbers when they load. Only used on GPUs that need it; a
  **64-bit shader fallback** switch (Graphics & controls → Display) forces it on for testing.
- **No BC (DXT) texture support on Mali:** textures are decoded on load, so the world renders.
- **No clip distances on Mali:** shaders are adjusted on load (some reflections may look off).
- **No 2× MSAA on some Mali GPUs** (G615, G710/G715): 4× is used instead, fixing a black world.
- Android C++ library gaps (`jthread`, `atomic_ref`, floating-point `from_chars`) filled in.
- The **Emulated** renderer is hidden on Android; the launcher always starts the Vulkan renderer
  (choosing Emulated used to crash every launch).

## Tips for better performance

The game is limited by its **CPU work**, not the GPU, so:
- Lower **Population density** and **Draw distance** in the launcher; resolution and FSR help little.
- Keep the phone cool: try **Heat guard** with **CPU boost: Steady**, use your phone's **game mode**
  (for example Xiaomi Game Turbo → performance), and avoid playing while charging.
- About **20–30 FPS** in the city and 30 FPS indoors on the Dimensity 8400. Phones with slower
  CPUs will run lower.
- Use PanVK drivers by [FristOneRR.](https://github.com/FristOneRR/FristOneRR-Panvk-Driver/releases/latest)

## Known issues
- Performance drops in busy city areas; clocks still vary with heat.
- The 64-bit shader fallback is new and untested on GPUs without `shaderInt64` — reports welcome.
- Some reflections or cut-off geometry may look wrong (no clip distances on Mali).
- Higher memory use than on Adreno (decoded textures).
- Occasional crashes may still happen. **Save often.**

## Reporting problems

Open an [Issue](../../issues) and attach `Android/data/com.libertyrecomp/files/last_launch.txt`
and, if the game starts, a log from **Play (Debug Log)** (`files/debug_logs/`). Please mention your
phone model and GPU.

**DISCLAIMER!**

!!! 10/16/2026 - On vacation until end of the month, fellas, no updates until then. Sowwy! Stick to forks and experimental settings until then, no issues will be sorted also. Touch grass like I do, it's necessary.  

This is pure 100% AI slop. I didn't made this by hand at all, it's all thanks to Claude and I, vaduur, take ZERO credit or responsibility of this port being unstable. It will run shitty, that's a guarantee. All I did is spent couple of sleepless night testing and pointing out the issues. Oh, yeah, and spent some pocket change on Claude sub ofc. Please be aware of it and feel free to fork this repo or use it as a reference in your future ReXGlue to Android ports. Thank you and have a nice day.

BTW, Any feedback is very appreciated, [Issues](https://github.com/vaduur/LibertyRecompAndroid/issues) are open, submit a ticket if you have any.


> [!CAUTION]
> This is an experimental, unofficial port of a project that is itself in early development.
> Expect crashes and rough edges. It has been developed and tested on **one device**, a
> Retroid Pocket 5 (Snapdragon 865 / Adreno 650).

> [!NOTE]
> New features land in **[pre-releases](https://github.com/vaduur/LibertyRecompAndroid/releases)**
> first, while they are being tested. The release marked *Latest* is the stable one. Pre-releases
> are listed above it and marked *Pre-release*. Feedback on them is welcome in
> [Issues](https://github.com/vaduur/LibertyRecompAndroid/issues).

**This project does not include any game assets.** You need your own legally obtained copy of the
Xbox 360 game and its title update. Nothing here helps you get them.

## Status

On the Retroid Pocket 5 with the default settings:

- The game installs, boots and plays: the intro, the early story missions, free roam and driving
  have been played. Saves persist across launches.
- The game renders at the console's native 720p with FXAA. The display scales the image to the panel.
- Frame rate is capped at 30 FPS with VSync. Most places hold a steady 30. The heaviest far views
  (bridges, the skyline at night) drop to about 25–29 FPS.
- Shadows, draw distance and the shadow map size match the console. Traffic and pedestrian density
  are reduced to 40% of the PC defaults to save CPU time.
- Audio works, including the radio, cutscenes and Bink videos.

Known problems:

- Occasional crashes to the home screen still happen. Save often.
- The in-game installer's **Select File / Select Folder** buttons do not work on Android. Install
  from the launcher (0.5.7+) or through the app's `install` folder instead (see
  [INSTALL.md](docs/android/INSTALL.md)).
- One deferred light-volume shader is skipped, because it hangs the GPU under Turnip. A few
  light volumes are missing as a result.
- The episodes (The Lost and Damned, The Ballad of Gay Tony) and online multiplayer have not been
  tested on Android.
- The on-screen gamepad is new (0.5.7.2) and has only been tried on the Retroid Pocket 5 so far
  (see [Controls](#controls)).

## Device requirements

| | Requirement |
|---|---|
| **GPU** | **Qualcomm Adreno 6xx or 7xx** (Snapdragon). Developed and tested on the Adreno 650. **Adreno 8xx: experimental since 0.5.7.5**, see below. **ARM Mali: very early experimental, not supported by the developer, since 0.5.9.3**, tested only on a Pixel 7, see below. |
| **SoC** | Snapdragon 865 class or faster recommended (SD 865/870/888, 8 Gen 1/2/3, 8s Gen 3, …). |
| **CPU** | arm64 with ARMv8.2-A (the build uses LSE atomics). ARMv8.0 chips such as the Snapdragon 835 crash on start. |
| **Android** | Android 10 (API 29) or newer, 64-bit. |
| **RAM** | 8 GB recommended. 6 GB is untested. |
| **Storage** | About 7 GB for the installed game, plus room for the disc image while installing (about 15 GB free in total). |
| **Controller** | An XInput (Xbox-layout) gamepad is strongly recommended, see [Controls](#controls). |

**Not supported:**

- **Samsung Xclipse GPUs** (Exynos 2200 and newer).
- **PowerVR GPUs**, Huawei Maleoon and anything else that is not an Adreno or a Mali.

Why Adreno: the renderer needs Vulkan 1.2 and was tuned on Turnip. Turnip is Mesa's open-source
Vulkan driver, and it exists only for Adreno GPUs. The stock Qualcomm driver on older devices
(including the Adreno 650) exposes only Vulkan 1.1. On other GPUs the bundled driver cannot load,
so the game has to run on the vendor's own driver.

**ARM Mali / Immortalis (most Exynos chips before the 2200, MediaTek Dimensity/Helio, Google
Tensor): very early experimental state, not supported by the developer, since 0.5.9.3.** It has
been tested only on a **Pixel 7** (Mali-G710) with the phone's own (System) driver: the game runs,
but slowly and with audio stutter. Clip planes are skipped (some reflections may show extra
geometry) and DXT textures are decoded on load (more memory, possible stutter while streaming).
Mali support exists thanks to the
[Mali fork](https://github.com/prollynotzjay/LibertyRecompAndroidMaliVer) and the patch in
[#62](https://github.com/vaduur/LibertyRecompAndroid/issues/62). Issues opened for Mali devices
may not be fixed.

**Adreno 8xx (Snapdragon 8 Elite and newer): experimental, since 0.5.7.5.** The game has been
started on an Adreno 840 (Samsung, Android 17). The bundled Turnip build does not support Adreno
8xx, so import a Turnip build for it on the launcher (**Import driver (.zip)**), such as the Gen8
Turnip builds made for emulators. This is how it was tested. Expect rough edges, and please report
how it runs in [Issues](https://github.com/vaduur/LibertyRecompAndroid/issues). Low-end Adreno
6xx parts (610/618/619) should start, but expect them to be far too slow.

Since 0.5.6.2, when the bundled Turnip cannot drive the GPU, the app falls back to the device's own
Vulkan driver if that driver offers Vulkan 1.2. It has been tested only on the Mali-G710 above. If no usable driver
exists, the app shows a dialog with the reason instead of closing silently, and it writes
`Android/data/com.libertyrecomp/files/last_launch.txt` with the device, GPU and driver details.
Attach that file when you report a problem.

## Controls

**An XInput (Xbox-layout) gamepad is strongly recommended.** For example:

- an Xbox controller over Bluetooth or USB;
- any XInput-compatible pad;
- the built-in controls of a gaming handheld (Retroid, AYN Odin, AYANEO and similar) in Xbox
  mode.

The game is the Xbox 360 version, so its controls and button prompts follow the Xbox layout one to
one. Other controllers that Android recognizes (DualShock, DualSense, Switch Pro and so on) usually
work through SDL. Their buttons are mapped by position, though, and they have seen much less
testing.

**On-screen gamepad (0.5.7.2 and newer).** Without a controller, the game shows a translucent
Xbox 360 controller on the screen. It disappears as soon as a gamepad is connected, and comes back
when it is disconnected.

![The on-screen gamepad](docs/android/images/touch_gamepad.png)

- **Left stick:** touch anywhere on the left half of the screen (outside the buttons). The stick
  centres where your thumb lands.
- **Right stick (camera):** touch anywhere on the right half of the screen. It works like a
  controller's right stick.
- **Buttons:** A/B/X/Y lower right, D-pad next to the left stick, LT/LB above the left stick, RT/RB
  on the right, L3/R3 next to the bumpers, Back/Start at the top. Several fingers work at once.
- **Menus** are driven with the same buttons, as on a controller.

Settings in `args.txt` (see [ADVANCED.md](docs/android/ADVANCED.md#other-useful-settings)):

- `--touch_controls=auto|on|off`. `auto` shows the overlay whenever no gamepad is connected, `on`
  always shows it, `off` never does.
- `--gta4_touch_layout=context` brings back upstream's context-sensitive touch layout instead of
  the gamepad.

## Game files required

- The **Xbox 360 GTA IV disc** as an `.iso` image. Only the **USA (NTSC-U)** release has been
  verified.
- **Title Update 8** for that release (version **0.0.8.5**), either as the STFS package or as a raw
  `default.xexp`. The PAL title update (0.0.8.6) is rejected.

The port was developed and tested with these exact files:

| File | Size | MD5 | SHA-1 |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Grand Theft Auto IV (USA) (En,Fr,De,Es,It).iso` (full disc image) | 7,835,492,352 bytes | `f0a046aed1520a913b2125f0a69ee7d0` | `caa48dfb3b1b2fe3131e61fc66e35a22c6d0ba13` |
| `TU_1A581VI_000000K000000.0000000000205` (Title Update 8, STFS package) | 3,715,072 bytes | `f041b5f6721d7ee578560bac21668826` | `88d1c438814298b6da987b3ad5edc7e48a769ac9` |

If your files match, they are known to work. Other dumps of the same USA disc (for example
trimmed or extracted images) may work too, but they have not been tested. Check your files with
`certutil -hashfile <file> MD5` on Windows, or `md5sum <file>` on Linux and macOS.

See the upstream [dumping guide](docs/DUMPING-en.md) for how to get these files from your own
console and disc.

## Quick start

1. Install `LibertyRecompAndroid-*.apk` from the [Releases](../../releases) page and open it. The
   app opens on a launcher with the game status, the installer, the Vulkan driver choice and
   **Play** (see [INSTALL.md](docs/android/INSTALL.md#2-open-the-app-the-launcher)).
2. In the **Game** panel (0.5.7 and newer), choose your disc image (`*.iso`) and the Title Update 8
   file wherever they are on the device. The app asks once for *All files access*. On older
   versions, or without that permission, copy both into
   `Android/data/com.libertyrecomp/files/install/` instead (a PC over USB is the easiest way).
   The tested files ([details](#game-files-required)):
   - disc: `Grand Theft Auto IV (USA) (En,Fr,De,Es,It).iso`, MD5 `f0a046aed1520a913b2125f0a69ee7d0`
   - TU8: `TU_1A581VI_000000K000000.0000000000205`, MD5 `f041b5f6721d7ee578560bac21668826`

   The file names do not matter, as long as the disc image ends in `.iso`.
3. Press **Install**, wait for it to finish, then press **Play**.
